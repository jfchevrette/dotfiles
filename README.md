# My dotfiles

This is a repo of my personal dotfiles. Some are highly customized to my needs and may not work for you. YMMV.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ```install.sh``` | Install Homebrew apps |
| ```update.sh``` | Update Homebrew apps |
| ```stow.sh``` | Use ```GNU stow``` to link dotfiles into $HOME |
